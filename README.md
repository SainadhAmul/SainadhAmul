Howdy! I'm a data science and AI enthusiast who loves to create cutting-edge solutions. With over 4 years of experience, My diverse expertise and work experience have empowered me to develop a multitude of AI-driven solutions. These range from computer vision and RCNN-based OCR engines to automated end-to-end machine learning applications, natural language processing (NLP) enabled RPA, anomaly detection on streaming and batch data, and MLOps for building self-sustained and monitored pipelines using cloud technologies such as AWS.

ps: This page is still a work in progress.

## üå± I'm currently learning and exploring...

- MLops for building self-sustained and monitored pipelines
- Vision Transformers
- Explainable and relialble AI soulutions

## :fire: Small Projects that I've worked with ChatGPT on: (WIP)

Who needs coffee when you have an AI model that can do the heavy lifting. I feel like Iron Man, building my suit all while conversing with AI, a trusty sidekick with minor flaws.

- [Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Implementation](https://github.com/SainadhAmul/crypto_bc_pycoin)
- [Project 2](https://github.com/username/project2)

how I feel after asking chatgpt to write test cases, create docstrings or more detailed docmentation for my work.

## üí¨ Ask me about

Data science, machine learning, AI projects, computer vision, NLP, MLOps, or anything related to these domains. I'm always happy to help, discuss new ideas, and share my experiences. ps: If you want to talk about how AI will eventually take over the world, I'm all ears!. because, if you know a "conspiracy theory" to be true, then it's just called "having inside information".

The best way to get in touch with me is through LinkedIn. Feel free to send me a connection request or a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can, faster than a self-driving car! üèéÔ∏è


## ‚ö° Fun fact

In my free time, I love to watching/reading science fiction content, especially realated to time-travel and other paradoxical concepts. I'm a big Anime fan, and any works of fiction and fantasy always get my attention. In addition to this, I enjoy reading comics and manga, with "Solo Levelling" and "Dragon Ball" being some of my absolute favorites. I also have a thing for movies, and "Jersey" (Telugu Film), "Interstellar" & "The Matrix"  are some of my favorites. And, just between us, I'm still hoping to receive my acceptance letter from Hogwarts. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìö
