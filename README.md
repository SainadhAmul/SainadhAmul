Data science, machine learning, AI projects, computer vision, NLP, MLOps, or anything related to these domains. I'm always happy to help, discuss new ideas, and share my experiences. ps: If you want to talk about how AI will eventually take over the world, I'm all ears!. because, if you know a "conspiracy theory" to be true, then it's just called "having inside information".

## ⚡ Fun fact

In my free time, I love to explore the world of sci-fi especially time travel related stuff. I'm a huge Anime fan and anything fiction/fantasy fan. I'm also love reading reading comics and manga. Some of my favorites works include "Solo Levelling" - manhwa, "Dragon Ball" -Anime and the "Interstellar"-Movie. I'm still waiting for my letter from Hogwarts, though. 🧙‍♂️📚
